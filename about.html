          <p>Long Tran is my best friend, him and his family immigrated here to Dallas, Texas from Vietnam when he was 
            9 years old. He effortlessly combined his Vietnamese heritage with his new experiences living here in Dallas. 
            I became friends with him in Middle School and have grown closer and closer over the years as we hang out and 
            play video games together. We are now both 22 years old and in university right now and both hope to get jobs 
            at the same company once we graduate. Long enjoys making digital art in his free time and livestreaming the 
            process on Twitch.tv a livestreaming platform. He also heavily enjoys 90s grunge music and spends a lot of time 
            learning his favorite songs on guitar and has hopes of making a cover band someday. He is currently attending
             university for Cybersecurity but has future plans for pursuing a Master's degree in Data Analytics. He hopes 
             to combine these two to further virtual security and start his own company to provide security services at 
             some of the top companies here in the United States. Long is one of the most ambitious people I know and has 
             a constant drive to learn new topics and broaden his horizons as both a creative and as someone interested
              in new technologies. Long has been an amazing friend and has helped me through a lot and is someone I know I
               can count on for whatever comes up, he is always down to go have fun and experience new things. </p>
