        <p id="galleryIntro">Long is an avid artist and someone who has been an artist all of his life. He has gotten his art into
          multiple regional art contests and school galleries here in Dallas. One of his dreams is to eventually do art full time
          and have his own gallery. His style is big on texture and getting that across on a digital level. 
          His style is full of surrealism and a focus on replicating the physical art process in a digital manner.
          Much of his artwork comes from his many inspirations including Japanese Anime and Manga,
          as well as impressionist artwork from the late 1800s. One of his biggest inspirations is Junji Ito a Japanese Manga 
          artist and writer well known for his horror manga illustrations. His next biggest inspiration is Claude Monet. Claude Monet is a
          French impressionist artist from the 19th century who took the world by storm with his impressionist paintings.
