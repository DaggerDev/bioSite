        <div id="shortBio">
          <p>My Best friend is Long Tran he is currently 22 years old, and immigrated from Vietnam to the United States at age 9. merging his cultural roots with new experiences and learning a new language along the way. He enjoys expressing his creativity in his free time through digital art, blending many different influences and inspirations into his works. He also enjoys learning and playing guitar in his spare time and likes covering Nirvana and a lot of his other favorite songs. He is currently studying and completing his degree in cybersecurity while currently interning at a well known prestigious company. I think Long's interests showcase not only his creative and artistic side but also his technical and logical side balancing his creative hobbies and highly technical degree field. Long since I have known him has been an amazing friend and someone who is always there to help and hang out with whenever needed.</p>
